# Django workflow goes
	1) An HTTP request comes in for a particular URL.
	2) Django uses some rules to decide which view fuction should deal with the request.
	3) The view function process the request and return an HTTP response.

# Django render function - It takes the request as 1st parameter and the name of the template to render.

# from django.template.loader import render_to_string

	expected_html = render_to_string('home.html')
	self.assertEqual(html, expected_html)

# self.asserttemplateUsed(response, 'wrong.html')

# from django.test import LiveServerTestCase

# Unexpected NoSuchElementException and StaleElementException errors are teh usual symptoms of forgetting an explicit wait.
